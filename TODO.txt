Further investigate CMake viability for build system.
	A CMake build system seems viable.
	A significant amount of work is required to bring it to comparable status, but seems like it has lower barriers to maintenance and change.
	The majority of work for the CMake build system is done.
Create tests for cmake operations.
	Increase test coverage.
Create custom functions to add source files and peripheral drivers.
	Vendor peripheral driver now available with VENDOR_FIRMWARE_TARGET.
	Consider changing firmware target to all or none of available features.
